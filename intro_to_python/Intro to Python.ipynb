    "## Types of Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables can hold many different `types` of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "What do I mean by `types`?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, Python (and most major programming languges) have multiple types of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will briefly introduce you to a few types below:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Numbers\n",
    "One type of data in Python are just numbers. These numbers can be `integers` or `floats`. `integers` are whole-numbers (including negatives) and `floats` are decimal numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 5 # this is an `int`\n",
    "\n",
    "y = 3.1415 # this is a `float`\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strings\n",
    "Another type of data are called `strings` that represent text.\n",
    "\n",
    "We call it `strings` because it means \"strings of characters\"\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name = \"Carl\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Notice that to set a variable to a string, you put the value `Carl` in quotes as such `\"Carl\"`. That tells Python that the value `\"Carl\"` is a `string`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Boolean (True/False)\n",
    "The final data type I want to introduce to you are called `booleans`. The `boolean` data type holds two values: `True` and `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`True` and `False` are neither numbers nor `strings`. They are `boolean` values that represent truth and falsehood.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = True\n",
    "\n",
    "y = False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we need these?\n",
    "\n",
    "It's because when Python evaluates certain expressions like the below, it will try to convert the expression into `boolean` final output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "x = 55\n",
    "\n",
    "if x < 100:\n",
    "    print(\"x is smaller than 100!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lines of code above, when Python executes the line `if x < 100`, it will take a look a the `x < 100` section and turn it into the boolean value `True` or `False` depending on whether `x` really is `< 100`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the boolean value is `True`, then the line of code becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if True:\n",
    "    print(\"x is smaller than 100!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And Python will print.\n",
    "\n",
    "Else, if `x` is not `< 100`, the line will become:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if False:\n",
    "    print(\"x is smaller than 100!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And Python *will not* print anything."

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "![Loop](https://cdn3.iconfinder.com/data/icons/transfers/100/239329-loop_repeat_refresh-512.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We use loops because there are many operations in programming we oftentimes want to repeat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "    * Squaring every number in a list of numbers (you want to loop the `square` operation once for each number)\n",
    "    * Printing a countdown (you want to loop the `print` command for each time in your count)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of loops in Python you'll frequently see:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `while` loop\n",
    "\n",
    "This loop executes as long as some condition is `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "while x < 10:\n",
    "    print('How many times does this get printed?')\n",
    "    x = x + 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, the instructions inside of the loop will be executed as long as the condition `x < 10` remains true.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question**: How many times does the above get printed? Are you sure? Make a code cell below (Insert > Insert Cell Below), copy the code into it  and run it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `for` loop\n",
    "\n",
    "A `for` loop is traditionally used to run a block of code a set number of times, rather than until a condition is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for x in range(0, 5):\n",
    "    print('How many times does this get printed?')\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
