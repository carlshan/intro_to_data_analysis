    "## Part 1: The Standard Deviation $\\sigma$ and the Standard Error $\\overline{SE}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Standard Deviation (SD for short) is one of the most important and popular topics in statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's used all the time and the symbol statistician use to refer to it is the Greek letter sigma $\\sigma$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What do we use the Standard Deviation $\\sigma$ for?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Standard Deviation, often represented by the lower case Greek letter sigma $\\sigma$, is a measure of how \"spread out\" or \"dispersed\" a set of data are.\n",
    "\n",
    "    NOTE: It is mathematically equivalent to the square root of something called the \"variance\", which is another measurement of the spread of some data.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the standard deviation, we can figure out how likely some points are to be different from the \"center\" of the data. We use it to learn if some results we got are \"weird\" or \"unexpected\" or if they fall within the normal range of what we should expect given how widely \"dispersed\" the data is.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do you calculate the Standard Deviation for some data?\n",
    "\n",
    "The general formula for Standard Deviation is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{N}{(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The above should be read: \"the standard deviation $\\sigma$ is equal to the square root of the sum of the squared distance between all data points and the average point.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Say what? \n",
    "\n",
    "To explain it step-by-step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the mean of the data\n",
    "2. Then for each datapoint: subtract the mean and square the result\n",
    "3. Then find the average of these squared squared differences.\n",
    "4. Take the square root of that and that is the standard deviation!\n",
    "\n",
    "### But what is it good for?\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll let Wikipedia explain at the following [link](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation):\n",
    "\n",
    "> Standard deviation is a number used to tell how measurements for a group are spread out from the average (mean) ... A low standard deviation means that most of the numbers are very close to the average. A high standard deviation means that the numbers are spread out.\n",
    "\n",
    "> [In doing data analysis] ... scientists commonly report the standard deviation of numbers from the average number in experiments. They often decide that only differences bigger than two or three times the standard deviation are important.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modifying the above equation: The standard deviation for the average \n",
    "\n",
    "So the above equation is the standard deviation of a set of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "What about the standard deviation for the *average* of a set of data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well you'd expect there to be some variability in some data if it was a sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you think there'd be more or less variability in the *average* of this set of data? E.g., if you were to take a bunch of samples, and find the average, do you think there would be a higher or lower variability in this average than in the original set of data?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is **lower**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just think about it. What has more variance: the heights of people living in a city, or the *average height of people* between cities?\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously there may be very wide differences within a city (e.g., some people are very short, others are very tall and the differences between them may be large.) But once you find the average of a city and compare it against averages of other cities, these averages should be much closer.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you take the average of a bunch of data, you are \"doing away\" with a lot of the variance inherent in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that the Standard Deviation $\\sigma$ of the *average* of some data is scaled down by a factor of $\\sqrt{N}$. As a result the eventual equation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sigma_{avg} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}{(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Another twist: standard Deviation when you're dealing with proportions rather than typical numbers.\n",
    "The equation I gave above is the general Standard Deviation formula. But there's a more specific formula we'll be using in this notebook that better applies to our example of figuring proportions of something. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of measuring the proportion of a population that has some quality (e.g., \"the proportion of a group of students who want more I-Lab classes.\"), the equation for the standard deviation can be simplified to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sigma_{avg} = \\sqrt{\\frac{p * (1-p)}{N}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "What do all these symbols mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll break them down one-by-one. Let's start with the left-hand side:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma_{avg} = $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The left-hand side of the equation says the Standard Deviation of the proportion, also known as $\\sigma_{avg}$, is equal to the right side:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sqrt{\\frac{p * (1-p)}{N}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $N$ is the total number of points in the \"population\" (e.g., the total number of students at Nueva)\n",
    "* $p$ is the true proportion of the population we're trying to measure (e.g., the proportion of students that would take more I-Lab classes if they were offered)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we don't know the true $p$ value. We are trying to estimate it by taking a sample of $n$ students (where $n \\lt N$, in other words we sample $n$ students that are only a subset of all possible $N$ students). \n"

    "\n",
    "Whatever proportion of students in our sample answer the question *(Yes/No) If we offered more Nueva classes, would you be open to taking it?* will be our **estimate for the value of $p$**.\n",

    "After all, if we knew that the Standard Deviation $\\sigma$ was really high (say, $25\\%$), then we can't really trust this survey because our data may be really dispersed. Getting a score of $26.6\\%$ isn't very reliable with a $\\sigma$ of $25\\%$ because it means there's also a good chance the $1.6\\%$ (calculated by $26.6\\% - 25\\%$) or even $51.6\\%$ of students want the I-Lab courses.\n",

    "### How come we don't know it?\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to know it, the formula for Standard Deviation uses the value $p$. But the value of $p$ is *true* proportion of students who would answer \"Yes\" in our survey. And we don't know this number. That's why we're doing a survey in the first place! It takes too long to ask each and every student so we have to estimate $p$ with our best guess from a smaller sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "We call this estimate $\\hat{p}$, or `p-hat`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We plug $\\hat{p}$ for $p$ in our original equation to get an estimate for $\\sigma$.\n",

You can do this mathematically or by simulating it using a computer. For example, you can resample your data thousands of times and calculate how often you get measurements as extreme as the one you first did.\n",
